{% callout type="warning" title="Oh no! Something bad happened!" %}
This is what a disclaimer message looks like. You might want to include inline `code` in it. Or maybe you’ll want to include a [link](/) in it. I don’t think we should get too carried away with other scenarios like lists or tables — that would be silly.

{% callout title="Demo Updates" %}
We try our best to continually update Prodigy. When updates are made will will update this demo and would encourage you to review changes to make sure you are getting the most out of the system.
