## Recertification Training Plans
When you or a user enters an NREMT or State EMS Credential that is associated with a training plan, it will automatically load the plan. Any class that is on the plan and completed between the initial date and expiration of the training plan will count on the plan. If a class is specifically designated to a category, the class will count in that category first. For instance, on the NREMT paramedic training plan, Cardiac Arrest 1 will first apply to that category. In this case, there are more classes than needed to fill the category. The user can choose which of these classes to use and the remainder will be moved to an elective option once the category is filled.

Next, we consider elective classes. Requirement categories can be designated as elective categories. In the context of the NREMT plan, the entire individual group is designated as an elective category along with the remainder of the local group. We will apply an elective class to whichever category is designated as an elective category and listed first. For an NREMT plan, elective classes will always go to the Local category before the individual category. 

Training plans track overall progress, progress for each individual group, and distributive classes for those training plans that might have a limit on distributive classes.

### Customization
Prodigy allows an individual organization to override certain requirements within a recertification training plan. Most commonly, a requirement set may be applied to the local category on an NREMT training plan to create a set of organizational requirements. For example, if you require 5 hours of specific training for an NREMT paramedic, all providers with that training plan will need to complete those 5 hours plus an additional 10 hours of electives to fill their local requirement.
## Agency Training Plans
Your organization can create custom plans and assign them to users. Currently, the Prodigy team will build these plans for you, but we are working hard to bring this feature to you. Once created, you can add a training plan to a user by adding them to whichever group is assigned the plan. These plans can then be reported on like any other training plan. 
### Anatomy of a Training Plan
In order to create a plan, it’s helpful to understand what your different options are. 
{%figure src="/images/training-plan.png" atl="Training Plansl" /%}
1. **Name** - Give your training plan a descriptive name
2. **Dates** - Unlike a certification training plan, these dates are set by you when building the plan.
3. **Description** - Not required but helpful for your users to understand what this plan is for.
4. **Image** - Any square image will do but not required.
5. **Requirement Groups** - These are best used to group multiple requirement categories. They are also used to control limits on distributive training. One common use case is for organizations that designate training plans by quarter, each quarter is a seperate group and only opened up one at a time.
6. **Requirement Sections** - A section is only use to help organize requirement categories and have no specific settings.
7. **Requirement Categories** - Classes are assigned to a categories. You will set the number of hours required for each category and set whether or not an outside completion can be used. Each training plan needs at least one category. Altough classes get assigned to categories, you don't need to assign classes. You may require that each provided attends 4 case reviews from any source and to complete this category they will need to add 4 certificates from live case reviews.
8. **Classes** - You assign classes in to a category. You can have more classes than are needed for a category and let the user pick which ones they use.
9. **Add Outside Completion** - Unless you set a category as not allowing outside completions, users can add classes taken outside of Prodigy using this button.
### Creating a Custom Plan
We have lots of options to make a training plan fit your training needs. But don’t worry, you can just send us a list of classes and we will set everything up to turn them into a training plan. You can also use the different options above, to tell us exactly how you would like a training plan laid out. If you are looking for something specific, we are happy to work with you to set up exactly what you need.
