## Recertification Training Plans
When you or a user enters an NREMT or State EMS Credential that is associated with a training plan, it will automatically load the plan. Any class that is on the plan and completed between the initial date and expiration of the training plan will count on the plan. If a class is specifically designated to a category, the class will count in that category first. For instance, on the NREMT paramedic training plan, Cardiac Arrest 1 will first apply to that category. In this case, there are more classes than needed to fill the category. The user can choose which of these classes to use and the remainder will be moved to an elective option once the category is filled.

Next, we consider elective classes. Requirement categories can be designated as elective categories. In the context of the NREMT plan, the entire individual group is designated as an elective category along with the remainder of the local group. We will apply an elective class to whichever category is designated as an elective category and listed first. For an NREMT plan, elective classes will always go to the Local category before the individual category. 

Training plans track overall progress, progress for each individual group, and distributive classes for those training plans that might have a limit on distributive classes.

### Customization
Prodigy allows an individual organization to override certain requirements within a recertification training plan. Most commonly, a requirement set may be applied to the local category on an NREMT training plan to create a set of organizational requirements. For example, if you require 5 hours of specific training for an NREMT paramedic, all providers with that training plan will need to complete those 5 hours plus an additional 10 hours of electives to fill their local requirement.
