At Prodigy, we follow data best practices to protect your information.

Your data is secure with us. We also perform frequent backups to make sure vital training data isn't lost. James keeps our support staff ready for any data loss by randomly deleting huge swaths of data that we need to restore quickly. We have also built trap doors, which when activated, delete entire tables which work as training exercise for our team.
