description: What systems can be integrated with Prodigy?
---

We often get requested to link other systems with Prodigy to make the user experience better.

---
## Single Sign On
Many services choose to use our Single Sign On (SSO) option to access Prodigy. Many organizations use SSO solutions provided by third-party vendors, which integrate with their existing systems and applications. We can integrate with standard SSO systems, if you have an existing system you use for authentication, let us know and we can work with them to allow SSO.
## Other Integrations
We currently don't maintain any public documentation on using our API. If you have other systems that you are looking integrate with Prodigy reach out to [Support@prodigyems.com](mailto:Support@prodigyems.com) and we can discuss the options.
