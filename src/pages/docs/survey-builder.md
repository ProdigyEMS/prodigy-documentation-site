## Question Types

### Multiple-Choice Single Select

This will appear similar to a multiple choice quiz question and allowed the student to choose a single answer. Any of the selection can also allow for free text, this is a great option if there is an "Other" option. Click the **Add Answers** option to add additional answers. You can also upload an image or video to these as well.
### Multiple-Choice Multi Select

### Free Text
{%figure src="/images/free-text.png" atl="Surveys" /%}
You can ask a question and give the student a free text box to enter their answer.
### Range
{%figure src="/images/range.png" atl="Surveys" /%}
For the range, we use a 1-5 scale. You can ask a question and the student can use the slider to choose their option from 1-5.

### Dropdown Select
{%figure src="/images/dropdown.png" atl="Surveys" /%}
The dropdown select is similar to the single select answer in that the student can only choose a single option. Visually, they will see a scrollable list rather than all options at once.. This is designed for questions that have many possible answers such as which state a student is in. This can be as either a comma separated list or a selection on each line. This is designed to allow for easy copy and pasting from other sources.

Once you have add all of your questions choose **Create Survey**.
## Edit a Survey
You can edit any survey using the same tool you use to build it by selecting a survey from the list.
