## Groups
Groups serve 3 main functions in Prodigy, a user can be in multiple groups but dose need to be in a group.
### Training Plans and Groups
Department training plans are applied to users based on groups. When a custom training plan is built, it will be assigned to a group. When a user is added to a group with a training plan assigned to it, the user will immediately be able to access that plan from their training plans tab. 
### User Tab Filtering
The user table can be filtered based on groups. This allows you to more easily manage large groups of users.
### Class Assignments
When assigning classes, you can filter your list by groups. This will allow you to easily assign a class to an entire group. You may want to assign a class to all Paramedics or all FTOs, this becomes much easier with groups. 
## Creating a Group

Groups are created from the department tab, by hitting the plus sign in the group panel. The only information you need to enter to add a group is a name, then hit Add Group.

### Deleting Groups
Hitting the pencil edit icon on a group brings up a modal that allows you to delete a group.
