If you are looking to complete a class for credit, please complete it from your user account. This class view is designed as a preview of the class.  
{% /callout %}
### Organization Classes
This section is broken up into two sections, the top half is the draft classes, and the bottom is the published classes. If you click on the class name, you will be brought into the class builder and can edit the class. The draft classes have a trashcan icon that allows you to **delete a draft**. The publish class section has an **Active** toggle, click this off will take the class out of the catalog for your users. You can come back and make the class active at any time.
