Prodigy has several options to complete classes on behalf of users.

## Completion Options
To give you the most flexibility with your Prodigy account, we give you several options to complete classes. Here are a few examples of how this might be used:
1.	You run a class live and want to use Prodigy to track completions.
2.	You run a class live and want your users to complete a quiz after attending the live sessions.
3.	A group of users watches a distributive or virtual live class together and you want to check them off as completing the content.  

To access these setting click on **Classes->Complete Class for User**.
